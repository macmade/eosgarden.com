						All that stuff is installed in a specific directory, separate from the system paths, so you don't have to worry when you upgrade your Mac OS X system. It does not replace any exisiting software on your computer. It's just here at your convenience, so you can concentrate on your development tasks, rather than on compiling and installing software again and again from scratch.
