					<h2>Overview</h2>
					<div>
						The goal of the Magic MakeFile is to provide developers with an automated build system, that can be used for various compiled projects, and easily configured to suit the projects' needs.
					</div>
					<div>
						It has been created in order to match the following features:
					</div>
					<ul>
						<li>
							To be much easier to use than the GNU AutoTools.
						</li>
						<li>
							To be compatible with many programming languages.
						</li>
						<li>
							To be extendable so actually unsupported programming languages can be added.
						</li>
						<li>
							To allow the generation of shared objects and/or libraries.
						</li>
						<li>
							To deal with dependancies between final exectuable file(s) and shared objects or libraries.
						</li>
						<li>
							To be highly configurable.
						</li>
						<li>
							To give the end user a clean and localizable output.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<h3>Supported languages</h3>
					<div>
						Actually, the Magic MakeFile can be used for projects written in C, C++, and Objective-C.
					</div>
					<div>
						Support for additionnal programming languages can be added easily. To learn more about this, please see the project's <?php print Eos_Menu::getInstance()->getPageLink( '/opensource/magic-makefile/documentation', 'documentation' ) ?> page.
					</div>
					<h3>License</h3>
					<div>
						The Magic MakeFile is released under the <?php print Eos_Menu::getInstance()->getPageLink( '/opensource/licenses/bsd/' ) ?>.<br />
						Feel free to use it and modify it for your projects, if you think it can be useful to you.
					</div>
