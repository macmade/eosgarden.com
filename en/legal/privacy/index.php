					<h3>Website Visitors</h3>
					<div>
						Like most website operators, eosgarden collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. eosgarden's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how eosgarden's visitors use its website. From time to time, eosgarden may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
					</div>
					<div>
						eosgarden also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. eosgarden does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.
					</div>
					<h3>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
					<div>
						Certain visitors to eosgarden's websites choose to interact with eosgarden in ways that require eosgarden to gather personally-identifying information.

In each case, eosgarden collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with eosgarden. eosgarden does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
					</div>

					<div>
						eosgarden may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. eosgarden may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, eosgarden does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
					</div>

					<div>
						eosgarden discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on eosgarden's behalf or to provide services available at eosgarden's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using eosgarden's websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. eosgarden will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, eosgarden discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when required to do so by law, or when eosgarden believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of eosgarden, third parties or the public at large.
