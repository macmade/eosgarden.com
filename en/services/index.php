					<h2>Specific services</h2>
					<div class="grey">
						Since 2006, the eosgarden team used to provide several specific commercial services, covering a big range, like specific software development, web technologies, CMS development &amp; integration, consulting in web or OpenSource technologies, computing courses for developers or end users, organisation of OpenSource related events, etc.
					</div>
					<div class="grey">
						Today, eosgarden is run only by one of its founder (myself), and only maintains its software and OpenSource development activities, meaning it does not provide commercial services anymore.
