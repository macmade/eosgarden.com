						One of the new features in Mac OS X 10.7 Lion is the "Resume" ability for all applications to save their last state, meaning when you relaunch the app or reboot your Mac, the application will "resume" and reopen again showing all of the windows and data that was last in use. This is a great feature for some apps and situations, but there are also times where you donâ€™t want past app states to reappear.

					<div class="grey">
						This application allows you to get rid of the saved state for specific applications.
